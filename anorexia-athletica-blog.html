    <h1>Understanding Anorexia Athletica</h1>

    <p>Anorexia Athletica, while not formally listed in medical diagnostic guides, is a very real and harmful condition. It’s characterized by compulsive exercise and an unhealthy obsession with body weight and shape. As Healthline explains, the disorder is often masked by a culture that praises endurance, fitness, and discipline.</p>
    <p>Individuals with Anorexia Athletica feel compelled to exercise, even through pain, injury, or exhaustion. Their self-worth is tied directly to how much they’ve trained and how little they weigh. Over time, this leads to a host of physical consequences including muscle breakdown, hormonal imbalances, and cardiovascular strain.</p>
    <p>The mental health effects are just as serious—heightened anxiety, body dysmorphia, and depression are common. What sets this disorder apart is the deep integration of identity with athleticism. It becomes difficult for the person to separate who they are from how they perform or how they look.</p>
    <p>Recovery requires a shift in mindset and support from mental health professionals who understand the pressures of sport culture. Education around healthy training practices, setting boundaries, and redefining strength are crucial steps toward healing.</p>
