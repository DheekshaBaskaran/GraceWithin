    <h1>How Eating Disorders Affect Young Athletes</h1>
    <img src="youth.jpg" alt="Youth athlete placeholder image">
    <p>For young athletes, the pressure to perform can quickly spiral into unhealthy territory. Stanford Children’s Health highlights that adolescents often equate thinness or leanness with competitive success. When this belief is reinforced by peers, coaches, or media, it sets the stage for disordered eating behaviors to take root.</p>
    <p>Warning signs include fatigue, mood changes, dizziness, irregular eating patterns, and secrecy around food. Young athletes may also begin skipping meals, engaging in excessive exercise, or withdrawing socially. Because they are often seen as driven or high-achieving, their struggles may go unnoticed until physical health is significantly compromised.</p>
    <p>Prevention and early intervention are key. Coaches and parents should model healthy relationships with food and exercise while creating environments that celebrate effort and growth over body image or results. Nutritional education and regular mental health check-ins can also make a difference.</p>
    <p>Helping a young athlete navigate these challenges takes empathy, support, and a community that values their well-being above all else.</p>
